#### Author: Tibor Auer

As one of the most popular games on app stores before being taken down, Flappy Bird does not need any further introduction. Now, it has come back alive, on Python based on PsychoPy
The main intention is to use for neurofeedback visualisation.

This implementation has been slightly modified and several parameters are available to tweak the game physics.

*It has been tested in Python 3.5 and PsychoPy 3.0.0.
